# Zebble
Zebble for Xamarin

Zebble is a framework for developing natives apps for iOS, Android, and Windows from a single source code base.

It is conceptually similar to Xamarin Forms and MAUI, but it's typically easier with less code needed.
In particular, implementing custom UI designs with Zebble is easier and faster
This makes it suitable for not only enterprise, but also consumer-facing apps.
